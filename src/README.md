# 2020 Clock/Calendar

A gadget that displays the current date as if we never left 2020.

After 31/12/2020 there's simply 32/12/2020. Then all the way up to 99/12/2020. Not sure what happens next. Maybe the world is already ended.

It runs on an ESP8266 (ESP-07 module). It gets the date from an NTP server, it does the 2020ization and shows the result on a TM1638-based display.
